Urban parks play a critical role in maintaining ecological balance, supporting biodiversity, and providing recreational and environmental benefits to communities. Olmsted Park, known for its intricate landscaping and rich biodiversity, serves as a vital green space in its region. Over the years, environmental changes, urban pressures, and invasive species have posed challenges to its ecological health. Understanding these dynamics, particularly through the lens of tree canopy cover, is crucial for effective park management and conservation efforts. Tree canopy cover is a key ecological indicator, influencing factors such as temperature regulation, habitat availability, and soil health. Analyzing changes in canopy cover over time provides insights into the health of the park's ecosystem and the impact of both natural and anthropogenic factors. This project focuses on comparing tree canopy data from 2022 and 2024 to identify regions where the canopy has expanded or reduced and explore potential causes for these changes.

To guide this analysis, we aim to address the following research questions:

Is there a relationship between tree canopy and tree species? This question explores whether specific tree species contribute more significantly to canopy coverage and how species composition influences canopy dynamics.
What is the relationship between invasive species and canopy changes? This question examines how the presence and activity of invasive species may influence or be influenced by changes in tree canopy, shedding light on potential threats to the park's ecological balance.
By conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Olmsted Park dataset, this project seeks to uncover trends and patterns related to canopy change. Integrating insights from a recent field trip and visual evidence will further enrich the analysis, offering a holistic understanding of the park's evolving landscape.

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed minimal differences between the 2022 and 2024 Cherokee Park datasets, with the exception of stronger correlations between invasive species in 2024. When comparing machine learning models, the Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance with an accuracy of 0.92 on testing data and 0.75 for predictions on the 2024 dataset, while the SVM model achieved slightly lower scores of 0.89 and 0.71, respectively. Feature importance analysis showed that the Random Forest model provided a balanced emphasis on invasive species, canopy, and understory features, whereas the SVM model relied primarily on understory data. Additionally, comparisons of average canopy coverage for tree types between 2022 and 2024 suggested a potential correlation between the two years. Notably, areas with dense invasive species coverage exhibited increased canopy coverage, which appeared to diminish the influence of invasive species on canopy dynamics. Overall, the EDA and machine learning models highlighted a stronger connection between tree canopy coverage and understory species, offering valuable insights into Cherokee Parkâ€™s ecological patterns.
